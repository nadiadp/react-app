# Check out the beautiful website:_[ https://nadiadp.github.io/react-app/](https://nadiadp.github.io/react-app/)_

This is my first attempt at familiarizing myself with React's library and Vite to create a website.

I followed along _Programming with Mosh's_ [&#34;React Tutorial for Beginners&#34;](https://youtu.be/SqcY0GlETPk?si=7du8cKx1cfiGM0M0) and then put my own little spin on it.

Here I also practiced utitlizing BootStrap's toolkit for making lists, alerts, and formatting photos.

I added a couple of interactive components:

- User can click and unclick photo to trigger audio
- User can click and highlight list items
  - The console logs which item is clicked
